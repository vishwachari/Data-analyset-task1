## âœ… Cleaning Steps Performed

1. **Removed Duplicate Records**
   - Used `.drop_duplicates()` to remove exact duplicate rows.

2. **Handled Missing Values**
   - Dropped rows where `title` was missing.
   - Filled `director` with `'Unknown'`.
   - Filled `cast` with `'Not Available'`.
   - Filled `country` with the most frequent country.
   - Filled missing `date_added`, `rating`, `duration`, and `listed_in` with default placeholders.

3. **Standardized Text Values**
   - Stripped extra whitespace from text columns.
   - Lowercased and cleaned column headers using underscores.

4. **Date Formatting**
   - Converted `date_added` to datetime format.
   - Extracted `year_added` and `month_added` from `date_added`.

5. **Ensured Proper Data Types**
   - Converted `release_year` to integer.
